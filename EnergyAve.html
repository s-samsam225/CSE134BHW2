          This app teaches sustainability concepts in an engaging way by allowing students to go through
          differnt rooms in a house and unplug appliances to conserve energy. This is often overlooked and
          many people are <em>unaware</em> of how much energy appliances can use when they are plugged in and not being 
          used. The app provides immediate feedback and users are able to earn points as they unplug each item. 
          When they have earned the maximum number of points for that level they are allowed to move onto the next level.
