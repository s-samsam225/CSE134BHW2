        <p>
          This app teaches sustainability concepts in an engaging way by allowing students to go through
          different rooms in a house and unplug appliances to conserve energy. This is often overlooked, and
          many people are <em>unaware</em> of how much energy appliances use when they remain plugged in and not in use. 
          The app provides immediate feedback and awards users points as they unplug each item. 
          Once they reach the maximum number of points for a level, they move on to the next stage — 
          gamifying everyday environmental awareness.
